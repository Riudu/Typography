        I quickly had my breakfast and went with my family there.
        There I saw a ton of shops set up in a Forest area. We bought some things and went for lunch at Shakuntala Hotel. After finishing lunch, we
        went to Srijoni Shilpa mela. There we saw some more shops set up and a demon mascot. We also saw some live statues and some Bauls performing on stage.
